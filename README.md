# blockchain

**What is blockchain?**

**Hash Cryptography?**
- SHA256 is developed by NSA
- There are 5 requirements for hash algorithm:
  - One way
  - Deterministic
  - Fast computation
  - The avalanche affect 
  - Must withstand collision 

**Imutable ledger**

**Distributed P2P network**
- Users in blockchain network can be connected each other. Each user has blockhain of system. 
- When a user insert a block into blockchain, rest of user will update their blockchain.

**Mining**
- This is while loop, to increase Nounce, one of element in Block, calculate the hash of block to satafied the target format. For example: 8 zero lead in the hash.
- **Why mining**? => The block needs to be mined to brings the actual value into currency, by mean of creating arfifical scarity. If there wouldn't be any difficulity to create new block, the currency would be worthless.
