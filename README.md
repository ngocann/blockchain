# blockchain

**What is blockchain?**

**Hash Cryptography?**
- SHA256 is developed by NSA
- There are 5 requirements for hash algorithm:
  - One way
  - Deterministic
  - Fast computation
  - The avalanche affect 
  - Must withstand collision 

**Imutable ledger**

**Distributed P2P network**
- Users in blockchain network can be connected each other. Each user has blockhain of system. 
- When a user insert a block into blockchain, rest of user will update their blockchain.
**Mining**
- This is while loop, to increase Nounce, one of element in Block, calculate the hash of block to satafied the target format. For example: 8 zero lead in the hash.
- **Why mining**? =>
